# Homework-4 p1
Run hwk4_p1-McKendreeSpringer.py by executing python hwk4_p1-McKendreeSpringer.py. This will print and save figures "Electric_Potential.png", "E-Field_Direction.png", "E-Field_DirectionAndMagnitude.png", and "E-Field_DirectionAndMagnitude-width.png", and it will also print the E-Field values at (0,0) and (5,7).
"Electric_Potential.png" is the answer to part 'a' of question 1. 
The printed E-Field values at (0,0) and (5,7) are the answers to part 'bi' of question 1.
"E-Field_Direction.png", "E-Field_DirectionAndMagnitude.png", and "E-Field_DirectionAndMagnitude-width.png" make up the answer to part 'bii' of question 1. "E-Field_Direction.png" just shows the E-Field direction. "E-Field_DirectionAndMagnitude.png" shows the direction and magnitude with the magnitude represented by arrow length. I was not able to make the width represent the magnitude, though there is code that attempts to do this for "E-Field_DirectionAndMagnitude-width.png".
# Homework-4 p2
Run hwk4_p2-McKendreeSpringer.py by executing python hwk4_p2-McKendreeSpringer.py. This should save figure "Interpolation_Examples.png" which contains the end result of all parts of question 2. However, I was unable to get scipy to work, so the overall code is untested, though individual parts not involving scipy were tested.
